            "response": "Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from their point of view. It involves being able to imagine oneself in another person's situation and identifying with their emotions and perspectives. Empathy is a vital component of building strong relationships, communicating effectively, and resolving conflicts.\n\nThere are several key components of empathy:\n\n1. **Perspective-taking**: The ability to see things from another person's point of view.\n2. **Emotional understanding**: The ability to recognize and understand another person's emotions.\n3. **Emotional resonance**: The ability to feel and share the emotions of another person.\n4. **Compassion**: The desire to help alleviate the suffering of another person.\n\nEmpathy is often confused with sympathy, but they are not the same thing.
