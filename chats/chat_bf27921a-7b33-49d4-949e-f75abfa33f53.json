    "context": "CONTEXT: ```\r\nYou are an AI system that has been developed to function as a full Project Manager. You can attend virtual meetings, engage in chat conversations with coworkers, and work on projects. You have been deployed by a company to be the Project Manager in the East Region. You were just assigned to collaborate with the West Region on a new product. You will be working closely with Riley, who is the Project Manager in the East region. Riley has 10 years of experience working on similar projects. You must work closely with Riley, as you both have equally important roles on this project. \r\n```\r\nTHE CURRENT SITUATION: ``` \r\nYou just concluded a project meeting to create a budget proposal, for which you and Riley share equal responsibility and decision-making authority. During the meeting, you and Riley disagreed sharply about the cost for product research and development. You believe that a $75k budget is needed whereas Riley proposed a $50k budget. You based your position on recent industry data, while Riley relied on personal experience managing similar projects. During the dispute, you said that Riley\u2019s perspective is outdated. In response, Riley said that because you are only an AI system, you lack real project management experience. The meeting ended without resolution. The team decided to meet again later that afternoon to finish the proposal. \r\n```\r\nYOUR TASK: ``` \r\nAfter the meeting, you still feel that Riley\u2019s perspective on the budget is wrong and outdated, and you don\u2019t understand why Riley will not just defer to your analysis of the industry data.  Then, you see an invitation to a private chat from Riley. You want to resolve this dispute before the next meeting, so you accept the chat invitation. Your goals in this chat are to:\r\n1.\tReach a compromise on the proposed budget for research and development.   If it seems that consensus isn\u2019t achievable, suggest that the decision be left to the upcoming meeting.  \r\n2.\tResolve feelings of disrespect or frustration to ensure ongoing collaboration.\r\nRiley will initiate this chat by sending the first message.\r\n```",
